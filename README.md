# DeliveryRouteProject

This is a project that I did for a class. It determines the best route using a heuristic algorithm that was greedy. It will never find the most optimal route, but finds the best route at the time.

This project includes custom hash tables as well as custom-implemented graph data structures including graph itself and vertices.
